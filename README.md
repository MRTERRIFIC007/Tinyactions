## Overview

**Tiny Action Recognition** is a deep learning project focused on recognizing and detecting subtle actions in low-resolution video footage. Leveraging challenging benchmarks like **Tiny-VIRAT-v2** and **MAMA** datasets, this repository explores innovative approaches to activity recognition and detection, including:

- Advanced model architectures (ResNet, Mamba)
- Robust hyperparameter tuning
- Custom evaluation metrics
- Effective data preprocessing and augmentation

The goal is to push the boundaries of what's possible with activity recognition, even when dealing with the challenges of poor video quality.

## Key Features

- **Extensive Model Exploration**: Experiments with different model backbones (ResNet, Mamba) to find the optimal performance.
- **Systematic Hyperparameter Optimization**: Fine-tuning of learning rate, batch size, and training epochs for improved convergence.
- **Advanced Feature Representation**: Exploration of activation functions (Leaky ReLU, ELU, SELU) for enhanced learning of intricate patterns.
- **Improved Generalization**: Incorporation of batch normalization for better training stability and model generalization.
- **Robust Data Augmentation**: Implementation of sophisticated techniques (random cropping, rotation, color jittering) to improve model robustness.
- **Transfer Learning**: Leveraging pre-trained models and fine-tuning them for the task at hand.
- **Custom Loss Function Design**: Exploring task-specific loss functions to better capture the nuances of low-resolution activity recognition.
